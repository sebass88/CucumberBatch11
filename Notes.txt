Framework -

it gives us organized structure
Proper folder heirarchy
single execution point
separate place for different code


We use maven as build management tool

group id - company name
artifact id - project name

main folder - for development code
test folder - for testing code
        -- java - for coding part
        -- resources for non-coding part

pom.xml -- to add dependency
it is a configuration file which is considered as a backbone of the maven project

Cucumber -- It supports behavioral driven development approach wherein we write our test cases specification in
            gherkin language (plain english).

         Keywords: features, background, scenario,

         Given - pre condition - Given user is navigated to the HRMS application
         When - Actions -- When the user enters username and password
         And - -- this tag can come with every other keyword -- And user click on login button
         Then -- expected output - result - Then user should be able to see dashboard page


Recap :

Maven - build management tool

test - here we write code for testing
    -- java - coding stuff
    -- resources - non coding stuff

         Given - pre condition - Given user is navigated to the HRMS application
         When - Actions -- When the user enters username and password
         And - -- this tag can come with every other keyword -- And user click on login button
         Then -- expected output - result - Then user should be able to see dashboard page
         Feature -- .feature -- to write scenario we use feature file
         scenario --
