Framework -

it gives us organized structure
Proper folder heirarchy
single execution point
separate place for different code


We use maven as build management tool

group id - company name
artifact id - project name

main folder - for development code
test folder - for testing code
        -- java - for coding part
        -- resources for non-coding part

pom.xml -- to add dependency
it is a configuration file which is considered as a backbone of the maven project

Cucumber -- It supports behavioral driven development approach wherein we write our test cases specification in
            gherkin language (plain english).
